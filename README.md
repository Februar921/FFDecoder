# FFDecoder-V1
FFDecoder V1 is finally out! It's a basic program that, obviously, decodes FFD letter code.  It was made in windows XP style to fit more in CPUF ages. You can tell Furymax (Development Team) how he can improve it, or what features to add. If you're affraid of virus, He can fill you the source code!
